Difference between List and Tuple:

1) List is mutable were Tuple is immutable.

2) The implication of iterations is Time-consuming in list,
The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster in tuple.

3) The list is better for performing operations, such as 
insertion and deletion, A Tuple data type is appropriate 
for accessing the elements.

4) Lists consume more memory, Tuple consumes less memory 
as compared to the list.

5) Unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur,
In a tuple, it is hard to take place.

# Python lists are resizable, C++ arrays are not.
# C++ arrays are a contiguous allocation of objects in memory, 
Python lists are a contiguous allocation of references in memory.
