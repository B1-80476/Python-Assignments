ANS(9)NumPy Arrays are faster than Python Lists because of the following reasons:  

1 . An array is a collection of homogeneous data-types that are stored in contiguous memory locations. 
    On the other hand, a list in Python is a collection of heterogeneous data types stored in non-contiguous memory locations.

2 . The NumPy package breaks down a task into multiple fragments and then processes all the fragments parallelly.

3 .The NumPy package integrates C, C++, and Fortran codes in Python. These programming languages have very little execution time compared to Python.



ANS(10) using tuple() function, we can convert list into tuple in Python.



ANS(11) We can get list off unique elements from a given list by converting list into set using set() function.
